## Requirements
- NodeJS v14 or higher

## Pre-Installation
### Configurations
1. Open file [swift.config.js](swift.config.js)
2. Edit the host of each environment at these lines:
```
const HOST = {
    local: 'http://localhost:3000'
    dev: '[dev url]',
    stage: '[stage url]',
    prod: '[prod url]',
};
```
3. Edit GraphQl endpoint of each environment at these lines:
```
const graphqlEndpoint = {
    local: '[gql endpoint for local]'
    dev: '[gql endpoint for dev]',
    stage: '[gql endpoint for stage]',
    prod: '[gql endpoint for prod]',
};
```
4. Setup environment variables in `.env`. See [Environment Variables](##environment-variables) section for more details.
5. Run / Restart the PWA <br />

## Installation
You can run the PWA manually run the command or using pm2.
### Manually run the command
#### Dev mode
1. Build static assets (do once only for the first time)
```
npm run assets:build
# or
yarn assets:build
```
2. Run it (sample for local environment):
```bash
npm run local
# or
yarn local
``` 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bulb: Please find more commands for another environments in [package.json](package.json)  

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on browser to see the frontend.

#### Prod mode
1. Build the static assets and the project
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
2. Run it (sample for local environment):
```bash
npm run local:start
# or
yarn local:start
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bulb: Please find more commands for another environments in [package.json](package.json)  

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on browser to see the frontend.

### Using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
PM2 is usually used in dev site environment.
The steps are same with the previous one. The only different is on the step number 2. Wrap the command in step number 2 with pm2 command, example:
```
pm2 start yarn --name "[project-name]" --interpreter bash -- dev:start
```

# Overriding
Do not ever touch files under under [core](core) folder!
Instead, please create `src` folder in the root (if not exists) then put all custom (including overriden files) in this `src` folder.

# PWA Config
Since version 2.5.0 Swift PWA must be get any config from graphql where config can be change from backoffice magento. Detail documentation can be read at [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DaZhkHjANgPfISH8eHS7T2njNCQhty1uORHTZ9fYIDk)

# Patches
### How to apply patch file for swift pwa project

1. copy file .patch to folder `./patches`
2. edit file `patch.sh`
3. add list file patch beetweek delimiter text `"Start of line patch"` and `"END of line patch"`
4. example code patch.sh after edit like here
```
...
######################### START of line patch ############################
patch -p1 --forward < patches/fix_loadmore_plp.patch || true
######################### END of line patch ##############################

```

# Environment Variables
Environment varibales are variables that defined in the server side. The typical information of variable environment is only for sensitive informations which will no editable by the user admin, such as Magento integration key, encription key, etc. Otherwise, configurations are stored in swift.config.js or Magento Backoffice.

**For local or dev site**, you can create `.env` file by duplicating `.env.example` file. This file contains the the default environment variables that are used by Swift PWA.

**For staging and production**, it requires infra's help. Please reach out the infra team to set the variables for each staging and production. Note: the values could be different between staging and production, such as the ACCESS_KEY.

Default environment variables in `.env.example`:
```
ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
ENCRYPTION_KEY=TXAjwm8k53PJG9NacLbyZavvQB2qBh43
ALGORITHM=aes-256-cbc
FCM_KEY_SERVER=
FCM_TOPIC=notificationspwa
SESSION_SECRET=asdasdd1212ads12!!!@**DADxx1
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=TXAjwm8k53PJG9NacLbyZavvQB2qBh43
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGORITHM=aes-256-cbc
```

Explanations:
1. ACCESS_KEY = This is a key that is generated by Magento (Backoffice > Systems > Integration). This key is mandatory for PWA to get store configurations from Magento via graphql. GQL query storeConfig requires this key for security purpose. The generated key could be different between Magento dev, staging, and production.
2. ENCRYPTION_KEY = Encryption key to encrypt sensitive data (required)
3. ALGORITHM = Encryption algorithm (required)
4. FCM_KEY_SERVER = Firebase server key (optional)
5. FCM_TOPIC = Firebase topic (optional)
6. SESSION_SECRET = Session secret (required)
7. NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY = Encryption key to encrypt sensitive data (required) -> This is for client side usage, consider make this different from the server side one (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
8. NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGORITHM = Encryption algorithm (required) -> This is for client side usage, consider make this different from the server side one (`ALGORITHM`)

# IMPORTANT NOTICE
## Note for version <= 2.4.9
### Homepage Setup
In the previous versions, Swift PWA comes with hardcode contents which are sliders, highlighted products list, and highlighted categories.
But we recommend to use CMS Page instead.
To do so please follow this step:
1. Download the sample CMS page from [here](sample/pwa-homepage.csv), then upload/import on Magento backoffice using Firebear feature
2. Update the Swift PWA swift.config.js
    - home ▸ useCmsPage ▸ enable = true
    - home ▸ useCmsPage ▸ identifier = "pwa-homepage" or any CMS identifier you created for PWA Homepage.

## Note for version >=2.6.2
### Store Configuration Setup
To optimize memory usage in swift PWA, store config will be cached in PWA server side by storing it in a JSON file (config.json). This file will only be generated when the PWA request the storeConfig query to Magento GQL. 
There are 2 ways to trigger this process (generating   config.json):
#### 1: Hit the API manually (Will be usefull for local environment)
1. Run the project
2. Hit endpoint `{host}/generate-config` with headers Authorization `Bearer {ENCRYPTION_KEY}` (you can use postman to do this). The encryption key value is from .env file with varibale `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
#### 2: From Magento Backoffice
1. Go to Backoffice > Systems > Cache Management
2. Click "Refresh PWA Configuration" button.
